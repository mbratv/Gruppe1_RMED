Project title: RMED901 project - Group 1
Authors: Marianne Bråtveit, Eline Hillestad, Ryan Dunkel and Jonathan Husebø Chambenoit
Project date: 2023-09-11 to 2023-09-15

Notes about the first day working together:
- We started working on our own branches, but had an agreement that it would be easier to work together on the main script where we discuss everything together and one person in the group make the changes
- Since Marianne had experience with R Markdown, she taught us the basics of R Markdown and we started the project directly in R Markdown

# First day (day 5 of course) #

Assigned the dataset to the object "data" and explored it

We tidied the dataset
- Renamed the columns "BMI kg/m2", "#attempts", and "#failures" to "BMI", "Attempts", "Failures", we felt that these names would be a better fit.
- Removed duplicates using the function distinct().
- Created new columns using pivot_wider.
- Split the colum "last_method_S_F" (old name) into "last_method" and "last_method_S_F" (new names). The old "last_method_S_F" contained information on both the last method and if the last method was either successful or fail, and we wanted this information seperately in two columns.
- Converted these latter columns to the type doubles since they were changed to character type after splitting.
- The tidied dataset was assigned to a new object "tidy_data".

# Second day (day 6 of course) #

We did some further tidying of the data by removing unescessary columns "month" and "year" (assigned to new object "data2"), then imported the additional dataset "exam_data_join.txt" (assigned it to new object ad_df).

The two distinct dataset data2 and ad_df were then joined using left_join() function by 'id' as this column was present in both datasets.

The merged dataset was named joined_df and the following changes were made:
- Removed duplicated by using distinct().
- Changed gender values from 0/1 to Female/Male.
- Added a column with the multiplication of the values of the columns "asa" and "Mallampati", named "Mallampati_asa".
- Created a new column with the quartile values of the ease column, named "Ease_quartile".
- created a new column that shows if values in "last method" contains the same values as the column "randomization", named "Method_check".
- We changed the order of columns into a preferred order (using the function select).
