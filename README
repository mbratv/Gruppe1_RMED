Project title: RMED901 project - Group 1
Authors: Marianne Bråtveit, Eline Hillestad, Ryan Dunkel and Jonathan Husebø Chambenoit
Project date: 2023-09-11 to 2023-09-15

Notes about the first day working together:
- We started working on our own branches, but had an agreement that it would be easier to work together on the main script where we discuss everything together and one person in the group make the changes
- Since Marianne had experience with R Markdown, she taught us the basics of R Markdown and we started the project directly in R Markdown. We therefore do not have separate R.script-files as we have done all the work in the rmarkdown-file.

Day 5 – tidying data

- Renamed columns
- Removed duplicates
- Created new columns
- Split columns
- Converted columns to doubles
- Saved result as "tidy_data".

# Second day (day 6 of course) #

Further tidying of the data:
- Removing unnescessary columns
- Imported additional dataset
- Joined the new dataset with the existing one

After joining the two datasets:
- Removed duplicates
- Changed gender values from numeric to character
- Mutated new columns

# Third day (day 7 of course) #

Analysis of data

- Tested if measurements were correlated
- Cleaned up the script
- Made adjustments to the plots to make them look better
- Tested whether age distribution depends on gender by creating a plot
- Tested whether age and BMI had a linear relationship
- Tested whether BMI depends on age by checking linearity and making a heat map
- Created a density plot to check whether intubation failures changed with age


# Fourth day (day 8 of course) #

Further analysis of data
- Tested whether randomization depends on gender (t-test)
- Anova test for whether randomization depends on BMI
- Scatter plot with regression line to check association between BMI and total intubation time
- Box plot to test difference of total intubation time differed between genders
